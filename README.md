## Description

Your Machine Learning Toolbox is an in-development Python package aimed at providing a diverse set of machine learning algorithms and tools. While still in its early stages, this toolbox is being actively developed to offer a wide range of options for building, training, and evaluating machine learning models.

## Features

- **Growing Algorithm Collection**: A variety of machine learning algorithms, each designed to cater to different tasks and use cases.
- **Flexibility and Customization**: Easily customizable algorithms and options to meet the specific needs of your machine learning projects.
- **Active Development**: Regular updates and new additions as the toolbox evolves.

## Installation

As the package is still in development, it's recommended to install it directly from the GitHub repository:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

# Import the necessary modules
from regression.linear_regression import LinearRegression
from utils.preprocessing import TrainTestSplit
from utils.metrics import R2Score

# Load your dataset (replace this with your actual data loading code)
X, y = load_dataset()

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = TrainTestSplit(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Instantiate the algorithm
model = LinearRegression()

# Train the algorithm
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_hat = algorithm.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
score = R2Score(y_test, y_hat)
print(f"R2 Score: {score}")
```
